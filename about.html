        <h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dual major in Social Computing and Financial Economics.
            My academic focus combines technology, data, and decision-making,
            allowing me to analyze problems from both technical and economic perspectives.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I play college basketball, which has taught me the value
            of teamwork, discipline, and leadership. I also enjoy problem solving,
            web design, and design in general. In my free time, I like watching anime
            and superhero content.
